Music Generator project for Simulation of Complex Systems course. Designed a music generator based on cellular automata to generate the notes. 
The course project was to use one of the methods given in the course to simulate a complex system. I decided to use cellular automata to generate the next chord of music. The progression of the CA gave rise to the note sheet, which was exported to a MIDI file to convert to sounds. The rules for the CA were defined to give dimension, pitch, and volume for the piece.
